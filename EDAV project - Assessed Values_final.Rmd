## Project Background

The Second Avenue Subway, a New York City Subway line that runs under Second Avenue on the East Side of Manhattan, has been proposed since 1920. The first phase of the line, consisting of three stations on the Upper East Side, started construction in 2007 and opened in 2017, ninety-seven years after the route was first proposed. Up until the 1960s, many distinct plans for the Second Avenue subway line were never carried out, though small segments were built in the 1970s. The complex reasons for these delays are why the line is sometimes called "the line that time forgot" (source: Wikipedia).

A brief summary of more important milestones is:

1919: original proposal.   
1942 - 1956: Parallel elevated lines along Second Avenue and Third Avenue were demolished  
1960: Increase in development on East Side, existing Lexington Avenue Line became overcrowded.  
1967: voters approved a Transportation Bond Issue, which provided over $600 million (worth $4,404,000,000 today) for New York City projects. The City secured a $25 million Urban Mass Transportation Act (UMTA) grant for initial construction.  
1972: Construction on the line finally began   
1975: Initial construction was halted because of the NY city's fiscal crisis, tunnels sealed later.  
1999: MTA Study proposed new subway service from 63rd Street north up Second Avenue to 125th Street.  
2000: MTA Capital Program Review Board approved the MTA's 2000-2004 Capital Program, which allocated $1.05 billion for the construction of the 2nd Avenue Line.  
2001: the Federal Transit Administration approved the start of preliminary engineering on a full-length 2nd Ave Line.  
2004: Approval of MTA's environmental impact statement (FEIS) proposing a two-track line from 125th Street and Lexington Avenue in Harlem, down Second Avenue to Hanover Square in the Financial District to be build in 4 phases:  
  - Phase 1 rerouted the Q service via the BMT 63rd Street Line and north along Second Avenue, to the   Upper East Side at 96th Street. 
  - Phase 2 will extend the rerouted Q train to 125th Street and Lexington Avenue.   
  - Phase Three, will run from 125th Street to Houston Street.   
  - Phase will extend service from Houston Street to Hanover Square in Lower Manhattan.  
  
#####Phase 1 only:
2005: Voters passed a transportation bond issue on November 8, 2005, allowing for dedicated funding allocated for phase 1.  
2006: United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) agave $1.3 billion in federal funding for the phase 1, to be funded over a seven-year period. Preliminary engineering and a final tunnel design was completed.  
2007: Final Phase 1 construction started.  
2017: after several news about progress and delays, phase 1 finally opened on Jan 1st. This phase 1 consisting of the 96th Street, 86th Street, and 72nd Street stations and two miles (3.2 km) of tunnel, had a cost of $4.45 billion.

#####Phase 2 only:  
2015: phase 2 was allocated $535 million in the MTA's 2015-2019 Capital Plan for planning, design, environmental studies, and utility relocation.  
2016: In March, MTA began advertising Requests for Proposals (RFP) for three new contracts for phase 2. In April 2016, the MTA and the State of New York reached a deal to restore funding to Phase 2, with a total of $1.035 billion allocated. On May 24, 2017, the MTA Board increased funding for Phase 2 to $1.735 billion.  
2017: by August 2017, preliminary work on the line was underway, and the engineering firm AKRF was updating the environmental impact study for Phase 2. 

#####Phases 3 and 4:  
Phases 3 and 4 have no funding commitments yet.

## Analysis of Property Assessed Values

One of the analysis we decided to perform to answer our question, was to see how the 2nd Ave line project has affected the Market Value of property located in the project's area of influence (basically, phase 1 and 2, because phase 3 and 4 have no funding commitments yet). 

We got market values dataset from The Department of Finance (DOF), which every year estimates the property's market value for all New York City properties, which is used to determine the assessed value and then the City's property tax rates are applied to the assessed value to calculate the property taxes for the next tax year.

The link to the webpage where we were able to find the data is: http://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-assessments.page

There, we were able to find the estimated property market values back to 2008, one dataset for every year. 

The results and conclusions after EDA were presented in separate RMD/Html files but just to summarize, we found inconclusive whether the 2nd Ave Line project has affected Market Value for properties located in the vicinity to the 2nd Ave Line. 

As an importance observation, we mentioned that the the only publicly available data offered by the DOF, goes back to 2007 only, while news about the project and properties in the are of influence becoming more valued, date back to 1919, with one of the most important milestones occurring on year 2000 when the MTA Capital Program Review Board approved the MTA's 2000-2004 Capital Program, which allocated $1.05 billion for the construction of the 2nd Avenue Line, with several other milestones occurring before 2007 when construction of the phase 1 started, so maybe the effect of the line in property market values near both phase 1 and phase 2, occurred in previous years, before the start of the construction of phase 1 while the project was finally becoming a reality.

So, as additional work, since we wanted to analyse years previous to the commencement of the construction of phase 1, We performed an additional research and were able to find property "Assessed Values"" back to 2003 in the "Primary Land Use Tax Lot Output" (PLUTO) dataset, developed by the New York City Department of City Planning's (DCP) Information Technology Division (ITD), which is New York City's primary land use agency. 

Although the property "Market Values" are different from property "Assessed Values", we found that they are linearly correlated since, according to the NY state DOF (https://www.tax.ny.gov/pit/property/learn/howassess.htm), the property "Assessed Value" is a percentage of the estimated "Market Value" of a property depending of the tax class so, as example, in a city or town assessing at 100% of market value for a specific tax class, the market value for that class is equal to the assessment value.

The PLUTO datasets that we will use here, are an extensive land use and geographic data at the tax lot level in comma-separated values (CSV) file format, containing more than seventy fields derived from data maintained by different city agencies.

The link to webpage where we were able to ding the historical PLUTO datasets is:
http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/bytes-archive.page?sorts[year]=0

There, we were able to find the property assessed values from 2017 year, back to 2003, one dataset for every year.

The PLUTO Data Dictionary defining the field codes and descriptions of the data sets can be found here: http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/data-maps/open-data/pluto_datadictionary.pdf?r=17v11

### Pre-processing of the Datasets

After downloading and extracting the zip files for the original datasets we read each dataset, take a look at it, read the corresponding Data Dictionary and inspect variables/column names.

Then we filtered Manhattan Zip codes that are within the area of influence of phase1 and phase 2 of the project (10065, 10021, 10075, 10028, 10128, 10029, 10035), selected relevant columns of our interest and added a column/variable named "Year", to indicate the year when the market value assessment was produced (for the 2019 fiscal year, the data was produces in "Year" = 2018).

After following the above process for each year's dataset, we combined year by year into a single dataset.

Next, we write a new file 'property_upper_east.csv' in the working directory, for future use whenever we need to read the data again, because reading the original files takes too long time:

```{r}
write.table(PLUTO, file="PLUTO_upper_east.csv",sep=",",row.names=F)
```
<br><br>

### Analysis of Assessed Values for Phase 1

Now we add a column called "Distance" and use the block number to record the approximate distance (in blocks) from each property, to the 2nd Ave Line.

For this purpose, we used the Block number column/variable and the official tax map for the City of New York, which graphically shows the the block number, street names and other information in the map. The link where we were able to access the online Digital Tax Map is: http://gis.nyc.gov/taxmap/map.html

Using that info, we were able to generate the following map, where we could manually place the pre-existing Lexington-Fourth Avenue Line (green line), the phase 1 of the 2nd Ave project (yellow line) and the stations entrances, to visually determine the block numbers that are near the phase 1 of the 2nd Ave line and their distance (in blocks) to the Line:

![](blocksphase1.png)
<br><br>

When determining the distances of the properties to the 2nd Ave line, we differentiated between properties to the left of the 2nd Ave Line and properties to the right of the Line, because we suspected that the influence of the 2nd Ave Line may be greater for properties to the right of the line than for properties to the left, due to the proximity of the pre-existing Lexington-Fourth Avenue green Line right to the left of the 2nd Ave Line project.
<br><br>

#### Properties on the left side of the 2nd Ave Line - Phase 1

For blocks to the left of the 2nd Ave Line, as we can see in the map above, we can determine 3 different categories:

1) block numbers that are within 1 block to the left;
2) block numbers that are within 2-3 blocks to the left; and
3) block numbers that are within 4-5 blocks to the left; from the 2nd Ave Line

Using the block numbers for each of the 3 categories detailed above, we can add a column called "Distance" and use the block number to record the approximate distance (in blocks) from each property to the left of the 2nd Ave Line - Phase 1:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
property_upper_east <- read.csv("PLUTO_upper_east.csv")
data_phase1 <- property_upper_east %>%
  mutate(Distance = ifelse(Block %in% c(1424:1427, 1529:1532,1539:1541,1423,1428:1433,
                                        1525:1528,1533:1538,1646),
                                 '1 block left from 2nd Ave line',
                          ifelse(Block %in% c(1404:1407,1512:1515,1522:1524,1403,1408:1413,
                                              1508:1511,1516:1521,1624),
                                 '2-3 blocks left from 2nd Ave line',
                          ifelse(Block %in% c(1384:1387,1495:1498,1505:1507,1383,1388:1393,
                                              1491:1494,1499:1504,1602),
                                 '4-5 blocks left from 2nd Ave line',
                                 'other'))))
#write.table(data_phase1, file="data_phase1-left.csv",sep=",",row.names=F)
```

Now we can visualize and compare the variation of Property Assessed Assessed Values over time, among the different categories detailed above. 

For this purpose, we first summarize by Year and Distance, then we scale the data and create an index to visualize variations over time with time series lines for recent years:

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=12}
#First, summarize by Year and Distance:
data_phase1 <- data_phase1 %>% 
  group_by(Year, Distance) %>% 
  summarise(Total = sum(AssessTot))
#head(data_phase1)

#Now, scale the data and create an index to visualize variations over time, then plot:
data_phase1 <- data_phase1 %>% group_by(Distance) %>%
  filter(Distance != "other") %>%
  mutate(index = 100*Total/Total[1]) %>% ungroup()
#head(data_phase1)

#save results to be used for presentation purposes:
#write.table(data_phase1,file="Markt_Value-2nd-ave-line_phase1_left.csv",sep=",",row.names=F)

#Plot time series:
ggplot(data_phase1, aes(Year, index, color = Distance)) + geom_line(lwd = 1) +
    ggtitle("Assessed Value Vs Distance to 2nd Ave (Phase1 - Left)") +
    labs (x = "Year", y = "Indexed Variation in Assessed Value") +
    theme_grey(16) +
    theme(legend.title = element_blank())
```
<br>

**Conclusion:** From the graph above, we think that it is inconclusive whether phase 1 of the 2nd Ave Line project is having an impact on the increase in Property Market Value for properties located in the vicinity to the left of the Line. The increase in market value seems very similar across the different categories.
<br><br>

#### Properties on the right side of the 2nd Ave Line - Phase 1

For blocks to the right of the 2nd Ave Line, as we can see in the map previously shared above, there are just 3 blocks between the 2nd Ave Line and the East River, except for a small row of few blocks located four blocks from the Line (at the north end), so we established 3 different categories as follows:

1) block numbers that are within 1 block to the right;
2) block numbers that are within 2 blocks to the right; and
3) block numbers that are within 3-4 blocks to the right; from the 2nd Ave Line

Using the block numbers for each of those 3 categories, we followed the same procedure described above to analyze properties to the left, going back to the original data to add a column called "Distance" and using the block number to record the approximate distance (in blocks) from each property to the right of the 2nd Ave Line - phase 1:

```{r}
property_upper_east <- read.csv("PLUTO_upper_east.csv")
data_phase1 <- property_upper_east %>%
  mutate(Distance = ifelse(Block %in% c(1444:1447,1546:1549,1556:1558,1443,1448:1453,
                                        1542:1545,1550:1555,1668),
                                 '1 block right from 2nd Ave Line',
                          ifelse(Block %in% c(1464:1467,1563:1566,1573,1463,1468:1473,
                                              1559:1562,1567:1571,1690),
                                 '2 blocks right from line',
                          ifelse(Block %in% c(1482:1484,1580:1583,1480,1485:1490,1576:1579,
                                              1584:1587,1590,1592,1589),
                                 '3-4 blocks right from 2nd Ave Line',
                                 'other'))))

Now we can visualize and compare the variation of Property Assessed Values over time, among the different categories detailed above, by following the same procedure described previously: 

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=12}
#First, summarize by Year and Distance:
data_phase1 <- data_phase1 %>% 
  group_by(Year, Distance) %>% 
  summarise(Total = sum(AssessTot))
#head(data_phase1)

#Now, scale the data and create an index to visualize variations over time, then plot:
data_phase1 <- data_phase1 %>% group_by(Distance) %>%
  filter(Distance != "other") %>%
  mutate(index = 100*Total/Total[1]) %>% ungroup()
#head(data_phase1)

#save results to be used for presentation purposes:
#write.table(data_phase1,file="Markt_Value-2nd-ave-line_phase1_left.csv",sep=",",row.names=F)

#Plot time series:
ggplot(data_phase1, aes(Year, index, color = Distance)) + geom_line(lwd = 1) +
    ggtitle("Assessed Value Vs Distance to 2nd Ave (Phase1 - Right)") +
    labs (x = "Year", y = "Indexed Variation in Assessed Value") +
    theme_grey(16) +
    theme(legend.title = element_blank())
```

**Conclusion:** From the graph above, although properties located within 1-2 blocks right from the Line have had a slightly higher increase than properties located within 3-4 blocks from the Line, we think that it is inconclusive whether phase 1 of the 2nd Ave Line project is having an impact on the increase in Property Market Value for properties located in the vicinity to the left of the Line.

### Analysis of Assessed Values for Phase 2

For phase 2 of the project, we followed the same procedure, using the planned path and stations for phase 2 of 2nd Ave Line project, adding a column called "Distance" and using the block number to record the approximate distance (in blocks) from each property, to the planned phase 2 of the 2nd Ave Line.

As described above, we used the Block number column/variable and the official tax map for the City of New York, which graphically shows the the block number (http://gis.nyc.gov/taxmap/map.html) so we generated the following map, where we placed the pre-existing Lexington-Fourth Avenue Line (green line), the phase 2 of the 2nd Ave project (yellow line) and the stations entrances, to visually determine the block numbers that are near the planned phase 2 of the 2nd Ave line and their distance (in blocks) to the Line:

<br><br> 

Using the map above, we determined the following 4 categories:

1) block numbers that are within 1 block to the left;
2) block numbers that are within 1 block to the right;
2) block numbers that are within 2-3 blocks to the left; and
3) block numbers that are within 2-3 blocks to the right; from the 2nd Ave Line

Using the block numbers for each of those 3 categories, we followed the same procedure performed above for phase 1, going back to the original data to add a column called "Distance" and using the block number to record the approximate distance (in blocks) from each property to the phase 2 of the planned 2nd Ave Line:

```{r}
property_upper_east <- read.csv("PLUTO_upper_east.csv")
data_phase2 <- property_upper_east %>%
  mutate(Distance = ifelse(Block %in% c(1654:1656, 1665:1667, 1788:1791,1647:1652,1659:1662,
                                        1783:1787), '1 block left from phase 2 line',
                          ifelse(Block %in% c(1676:1678, 1687:1689, 1801:1803,1669:1675,
                                              1680:1684,1795:1797),'1 block right from phase 2 line',
                          ifelse(Block %in% c(1625:1640,1643:1645,1767:1776),
                                 '2-3 blocks left from phase 2 line',
                          ifelse(Block %in% c(1691,1693:1696,1699:1705,1708:1711,1713,1715:1716,                                              1806:1808,1815,1816,1811,1813),
                                 '2-3 blocks right from phase 2 line',
                                 'other')))))
```

Now we can visualize and compare the variation of Property Assessed Values over time, among the different categories detailed above, by following the same procedure described previously: 

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=12}
#First, summarize by Year and Distance:
data_phase2 <- data_phase2 %>% 
  group_by(Year, Distance) %>% 
  summarise(Total = sum(AssessTot))
#head(data_phase1)

#Now, scale the data and create an index to visualize variations over time, then plot:
data_phase2 <- data_phase2 %>% group_by(Distance) %>%
  filter(Distance != "other") %>%
  mutate(index = 100*Total/Total[1]) %>% ungroup()
#head(data_phase2)

#save results to be used for presentation purposes:
#write.table(data_phase1,file="Markt_Value-2nd-ave-line_phase1_left.csv",sep=",",row.names=F)

#Plot time series:
ggplot(data_phase2, aes(Year, index, color = Distance)) + geom_line(lwd = 1) +
    ggtitle("Assessed Value Vs Distance to 2nd Ave (Phase 2)") +
    labs (x = "Year", y = "Indexed Variation in Assessed Value") +
    theme_grey(16) +
    theme(legend.title = element_blank())
```
<br>

**Conclusions:** From the graph above we think that it is inconclusive whether the planned phase 2 of the 2nd Ave Line project is having an impact on the increase in Property Assessed Value for properties located in the vicinity of the Line.

So as final conclusion, even after extensive work and effort put into being able to analyze years previous to the commencement of the construction of phase 1, after exploring different dataset, we were not able to get any conclusion on whether the 2nd Ave Line project has affected Market and/or Assessed Value for properties located in the vicinity to the 2nd Ave Line.

**Additional work performed:** After our analysis, we tried to explore and visualize the data to try to find out if there was any different result by analyzing separately residential and commercial properties, but we didn't find any interesting result.
